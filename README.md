This is a Travel Explorer page, made to help users find and explore travel destinations easily.
At the top, there is a navigation bar with links to Destinations and Contact, which switches to a hamburger menu on mobile.
The hero section has a full-screen travel image, a heading, a short description, and a booking/search form where users can enter destination, date, and number of travelers.
The popular destinations section shows cards for Paris, Tokyo, and Maldives, each with a beautiful image and name.
The website supports dark mode, so users can switch to a dark theme for comfortable viewing.
There is a contact section with a simple form to collect the user’s name, email, and message.
The footer displays copyright information and also changes color in dark mode.
The website is fully responsive, working well on desktop, tablets, and mobile screens.
Animations like fade-in effects on the hero and hover scaling on the cards make the website visually appealing.
The design is clean, modern, and easy to navigate, giving a professional feel like a real travel website.
It uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for dark mode and mobile menu interactivity.
This project demonstrates front-end development skills and shows how to build a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly page.
